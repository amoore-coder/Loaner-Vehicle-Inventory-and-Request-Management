This project is a custom application built for a fictitious loaner vehicle company called FleetFlex Rentals with the end users being contractors. The application will automate the vehicle request processes for the contractors. I created this application as part of a hands-on application development project presented by SNPDG. We took an agile approach with completing the project in 3 sprints, which took 7 weeks.
